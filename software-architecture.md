# Software Architecture

## Model-View-Controller Architecture

### Model

To separate the model from the user interface (view + controller)

Independent of the GUI

Active model

- defines a change notifictoin mechanism that view and controller can subscribe to

Passive model

- Model is called by view

### View

The UI representation based on the model

Informs the controller of the user actions

### Controller

Deals with user/view input

## Model-View-Presenter

## Pipe-And-Filter

## Map-Reduce

## Layered Architecture

Example: OS

- Starts off at the kernal, a layer above we have utilities, a layer above we have application layer

## Event based - Implicit Invocation
